# Homepage: Horiseon Social Solution Services, Inc.

## Project Description

This webpage was designed to showcase the services that Horiseon provides, such as solutions for public and private entities aiming to enhance and polish their online reputation.

* **Motivation** Original code needed to be refactored to improve accessibility standards.

* **Contribution** Redundant CSS and HTML modifications were grouped and the overall length of code was significantly reduced. Meta tags were replaced with semantic tags. Overall accessibility was improved. Comments were also added to aid navigation of the code.

* **Solutions** The code performs the same tasks with less computing power needed. Furthermore, it's more concise and intelligible for younger developers as well as more accessible for individuals with disabilities. 

* **Application** By completing this project, I was exposed to semantic tags for the first time as well as the concept of accessibility. I also learned how to create a repo that I can then modify through terminal.
